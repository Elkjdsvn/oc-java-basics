# Java Basics Practice Repository

This repository contains my practice exercises and code examples as I learned the fundamentals of Java programming.

**Purpose:**

This repository was created to solidify my understanding of core Java concepts and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It served as a learning ground as I worked through various Java tutorials and exercises on OpenClassrooms' website.

**Key Concepts Demonstrated:**

* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**  Demonstrates understanding of classes, objects, interfaces, enums, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction (mention specific examples if you can easily point to them in the code).
* **Data Structures:**  Implementation of basic data structures (Lists, Maps, Sets).
* **Control Flow and Logic:**  Exception handling and logging through Log4J2.
* **Input/Output Operations:**  Working with console and file I/O through data streams.
* **Basic Java Syntax and Best Practices:**  Adherence to Java coding conventions and best practices for readability.
* **Further concepts:** Factory design pattern, lambdas and basic use of threads and virtual threads.

**Technologies Used:**

* **JDK 21**
* **Visual Studio Code**

**Learning Outcomes:**

Through this repository, I gained a solid foundation in Java programming fundamentals, enabling me to move on to more advanced topics and frameworks like Spring.  I focused on writing clean, understandable code and applying OOP principles effectively.
